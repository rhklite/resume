## Stress Management

1. i find that i get stressed when I have too many things or is thinking about too many potential problems and gets overwhelmed. My strat is to get organized. Make a list of everything i need to do. Prioritize the tasks to prevent other peopls gated by my work. Ask for help on things that I cannot finish etc.
2. Breathing exercise. Might sound silly, but its an effective way to almost recalibrate my mentality when sometimes I feel overwhelmed. It helps cool off and keep me level headed.
3. Getting a hobby for something fun. I really like working on things that look cool, and I get a lot of joy out of it. Some jobs are very interesting; but its not really the same with a hobby, since it has that level of stress associated with it. But these projects are very stress free and its all pure fun. I'm currently building a robot to entertain my cat. I call it the Ellie chaser project. My cat's name is  Ellie.
4. Working out is a great way to deal with stress.
5. Talking to co-workers, just generally hanging out.


## Weakness

- listed in the order of significance 

### Overly Cautious

I'm a fairly cautious person, as in, i want to make sure I have a good handle on situations before I dive into a problem. That's good in some regards, but sometimes, it means that I don't take risks that I should. This just leads to inaction. And inaction is worse than making a mistake. I shouldn't be afraid to make calculated mistakes, because it means I will learn faster, where inaction is never as effective.

**An example**: when i'm learning RL on my own; i often try to have a very solid understanding of the algorithms, including the underlying math. But this is sometimes a waste of time, because only a high level intuitive understanding is sufficient for the problem i'm solving. So it would be more efficient to just go and 

**An Example**: In Co-op, there was an engineering problem that I was trying to figure out. And I running back and forth between senior engineers to discuss, and doing a lot of engineering testing to make sure my claims were backed. Even though at the time, we still had questions; 

### Close My Self in a Bubble

- When I'm under pressure/stress, I start to not talk to my co-workers/labmates. I would be super concentrated on my work, thinking about that problem on

### hesitate to challenge a more authoritative

- i feel like i sometimes would hesitate to challenge a more authoritative persons opinion or approach to a problem when i believe it should be challenged, out of not wanting to look silly, or due to the seniority of the other person.
- when this happened in the past, it caused the project a lot of time and wasted effort. And i would aftwewards feel partially responsible because i have the responsibility to voice my opibion at the time, but i didnt.

- **Say this version for humor when appropriate**
    - Whenever im under pressure, or just a thinking about stuff, my face just stay in its natural resting position. But i have resting bitch face, cause my eyebrows points down. So i often got people who worked with me asked me if im angry at them in the past. I'm trying to be a lot more conscious of this, smile more, joke around with people more so they know im not mad at them. 

- for weakness, i think i can only improve by being aware of it, so i can know that im doing something i shouldn't be doing when im in that situation again, and i can break out of my usual habit to change this.

- I'm sometimes impatient about resolving a problem. However sometimes, the better solution is to let the problem sit for a bit, or let the situation cool down a bit before tackling it. However, there are times I would try to resolve it right away, but that would just cause unnecessary stress on myself.
    -  **This needs an appropriate example**


## Strength

- a strong sense of responsibility.

### How do you handle difficult team mates.

- I usually try my best stay calm, try to put my self in their shoes to understand their viewpoint better and see if there is any miscommunication that's causing this difficultness. In most of my experience, a lot of the perceived difficulty is from miscommunication. 
- **Example 1: Mark Lucas, Director of Technology**, I was presenting my investigation results at a meeting to CTO, and all the senior engineers in my team. Mid way through my presentation he started super angry at me as he believe i ignored his suggestions. So i calmly explained that I was only at the beginning. 

- If the team mate is especially difficult, I typically try to play a mediator role. The point is to the best of my abilities to maintain a team that can work together as well as possible. 
- This will mean saying no to certain things as well. When i do need to, I do it objectively as possible and give solid justification and appropriate delivery to make sure things are not taken personally.
